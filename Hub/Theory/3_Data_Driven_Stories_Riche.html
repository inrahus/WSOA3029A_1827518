                    "Data-driven Storytelling" - Chapter 9 - N. H. Riche et al. - A Close Reading &
                    Reflection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When communicating data, we must consider the audience – their wants, knowledge, and their
                    environment. In theory it may seem achievable, but the practicality of knowing and understanding a
                    broad audience that interacts with the data story - their individual environments, backgrounds and
                    knowledge - to the extent where the communication can be tailored to address them all, is almost -
                    if not - impossible. However, despite such limitations, this aspect of developing data stories – the
                    importance of the audience and these factors allows for more functional and meaningful
                    communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many cases where the authors of data stories receive detailed information about their
                    target audience, but some do not – often targeting a broader audience with unknown familiarity
                    levels with visualizations and thereby varying expectations (Riche et al., 2018). Riche et al. makes
                    the comparison between an academic researcher, who would most likely be an understood target
                    audience, where their wants and needs and expectations are addressed and known – contrastingly, a
                    general reader of a paper (Riche et al., 2018) forms part of a broad audience where
                    socio-environmental factors as well as background, impact the experience of the reader drastically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so, to address this, Riche et al. covers the aspect of the Annotation Layer (Riche et al.,
                    2018). Mostly in news graphics, this prominent accessibility feature is paired with or integrated
                    into a data visualization. Not only does it introduce the context of the visual, but also include
                    explanations on how to read the chart (Riche et al., 2018) and in a simple way denotates the main
                    takeaways of the chart at hand. It is important to note that although this function serves to
                    further make the information accessible – it is in the ethical obligations of the data storyteller
                    to make sure that their visuals do not cause or lead to unnecessary skewed interpretations (Riche et
                    al., 2018), which is why it is important to research and consider the literacy of the audience
                    expected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the different levels of literacy there becomes an availability to target niches within the
                    audience – where one would need to consider the basis of the audience’s level of knowledge (Riche et
                    al., 2018), such as in the case of an academic researcher or in the broader sense of maybe a
                    newspaper, the finance section would allow a heavier focus on financial reporting and thus consider
                    the baseline of knowledge of someone in the financial sector. Although, attempting to achieve, or
                    aiming for a universal design as a data storyteller would be more contributive to accessibility,
                    sometimes there are considerations and compromises that have to be made (Riche et al., 2018) – often
                    detaching parts of an audience while simultaneously attracting and maintaining another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another aspect of the audience to consider is their expectations. When marketing data stories to an
                    audience, there is an element of design expectation that comes with the audience’s interaction
                    (Riche et al., 2018). Often outlets that operate by targeting niche audiences will utilize visual
                    branding – in terms of colour font and layout consistency, to allow easier identifiability of their
                    products (Riche et al., 2018) and services, while also promoting conventions of association (Riche
                    et al., 2018) and incorporating the narrative cohesively. A flip side to this branding element is
                    its impermeable nature across cultural contexts. Colour contexts, layout and overall expectations
                    differ geographically (Riche et al., 2018). What may seem plausible and marketable in the Western
                    space may not be as relevant or understandable in the Eastern context. Data stories targeted at a
                    global audience find themselves in a more complicated design process because of the nature of
                    context (Riche et al., 2018).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While considering these individual aspects of the audience, of knowledge, literacy and expectation,
                    Riche et al. also presents that the motivation for consumption of the data narratives (Riche et al.,
                    2018) also further allow for a more tailored data visualization. Depending on whether the viewer is
                    approaching the media from a socially influenced, entertainment seeking or informational perspective
                    (Riche et al., 2018), will give insight into how the data story should or could operate and what
                    platforms of communication can be targeted to breach into the audience targeted. By considering
                    where the audience is most likely to interact with the visualization, there can be a different
                    design approach that targets the medium in which the audience is exposed to the data story (Riche et
                    al., 2018).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way to consider the audience, is through direct and personal involvement. Through personal
                    involvement, the data displayed will target or allow personal factors to contribute to how the data
                    is consumed or who consumes it. This can be quite tricky as the data can easily be skewed,
                    conflicting with the data storyteller’s ethical obligations (Riche et al., 2018). However, it is not
                    impossible. By including self-identifying factors (Riche et al., 2018) in the statistics – such as
                    living area, race, age, occupation etc, we allow for the audience to be more individually associated
                    with the data story presented. If we show in the visualisations, similar factors between the
                    audience and the data presented (Riche et al., 2018), we allow for a more interpersonal connection,
                    and can use the previously discussed motivations for the information, to create a complete and
                    directed visualisation for a broad but also somewhat specific group of the population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way to incorporate and include the audience is in the most direct manner, where they can be
                    asked to explicitly add to the data visualisation. Through interactive means, the audience can be
                    asked to give estimates, thoughts, or predictions on the outcomes of some statistical results (Riche
                    et al., 2018). This allows a direct involvement and targets the curious human nature, allowing for
                    the data story to permeate more efficiently among the audience. It also removes the previous ethical
                    skewing issue and can possibly be done in a space where the knowledge and background of the involved
                    audience is not easy to achieve. These studies into interactivity and personalisation have yielded
                    positive interaction results (Riche et al., 2018), and I believe will in future impact the data
                    storytelling scene quite positively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a whole I believe Riche et al. were able to cohesively explain and exemplify the ways in which
                    the audience is a major factor in the development and design process of data storytelling. They not
                    only were able to show what factors would influence the audience, and what factors would need to be
                    considered by authors and designers alike, but also what limitations there are to these factors, and
                    how some could be addressed and where there would need to be compromise. They also explored how the
                    industry and uses could be further through direct involvement and personalisation, as well as how to
                    achieve these on a broader scale while considering what the motivations of the audience could be and
                    how those would affect the approach to the data story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall I found the piece to be very informative, and can be well used as a theoretical backing and
                    practical guideline for how to tackle the audience factor in visualisation of data.
