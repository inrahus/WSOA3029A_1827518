                    "A Brief History of Data Visualisation" - M. Friendly - Analysis of Historic Data
                    Visualisation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Friendly’s Brief History of Data Visualizations shows the progress of data mapping across eras using
                    his
                    Milestone project. With this, Friendly was able to document a comprehensive history of data
                    visualizations, of which the earliest forms were maps and geometric diagrams that detailed star
                    positions and aided in navigation. As technology and time progressed, more methods were founded,
                    allowing for the recording, and representing of amount and location – particularly the
                    revolutionary,
                    triangulation method which furthered navigation even more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following this - from the mid-1800s to the beginning of the 1900s, the Golden Age of statistical
                    graphics occurred – and the major contributions of Playfair prior to this boom, gave way to the
                    emergence of modern graphics, creating an explosive wave of diagrams which are still prominent and
                    in use today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was in the very beginning of this era, during the Crimean War, that another fundamental figure,
                    pioneered the use of a variant of the pie chart, to document and vividly illustrate the sources of
                    patient mortality during the war at her station. Florence Nightingale’s use of the polar area
                    diagram (also known as the Nightingale Rose Diagram, or coxcombs) contributed significantly to
                    changes in her time but not in the manner most would think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noted by Friendly, Nightingale’s contributions in the statistical manner, had major impacts on the
                    political scene in her time. With the use of her data visualizations, Nightingale was able to
                    campaign for and successfully achieve better sanitary conditions for soldiers treated on the
                    battlefield. Her use of the diagram below gave solid evidence, showcasing that a majority of the
                    deaths of
                    soldiers on the battlefield, was not at their enemies hands, but because of the conditions of the
                    field hospitals in place to treat them when ill and wounded.

                    As we can see in the coxcomb diagram detailed above, the blue-shaded area depicts preventable
                    deaths, and deaths by Mitigable Zymotic diseases, the black-shaded depicts deaths from other causes
                    (particularly presumed to be combat), while the red-shaded refers to wound related deaths. Each
                    wedge represents the deaths per month. In the image we can see two different coxcombs – a comparison
                    in deaths and their causes with a space of two years between.

                    Nightingale's contributions to the political scene through her use of statictical data, not only
                    showed
                    the value of the study, but was one of many pivot points in grahpical innovation and in political
                    standpoint. Her consistent mortality accounting was not only able to advocate for better standards
                    of
                    treatment during the war, but also allowed for the accounting of discrepencies between the actual
                    happenings in the field hospital and that which was report and sent back to the mainland. After the
                    Crimean War and Nightingale's significant contributions, there were long term changes made
                    militially - in other words, drastic reforms. WIthoit NIghtingale's innovation and use of dtata, the
                    medical scene would not have developed to it's current statistical position. The recording and
                    acknowledgement of a mortality rate and contributing factors paved the way for saniary regulations
                    both on the battlefield, and in the mainland hospitals - of which were shared worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nightingale's principles are still refered to today and aid not only militia, but regualr operating
                    hospitals - and this all began from a single pie chart-esque diagram.
