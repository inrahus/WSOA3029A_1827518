                    "Theories of Representation" - Chapter 1 - J. Kidd - A Close Reading
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kidd addresses five main factors in her discussion of representation - namely the relations between
                    representation and, reality, myth, visual communication, persuasion and identity politics – key
                    topics in debates that surround the concept of representation, as well as aspects that are critical
                    in the understanding of the concept and for the use of it as a basis of study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Kidd’s reading, there is first a need to understand the relation between representation and
                    reality – referencing Saussure and Chandler as she explains how signs form and inform our reality.
                    This is where the importance of representation is established. By understanding how language and
                    visuals operate in a manner where they have no meaning unless they are assigned a meaning, we can
                    understand how signs and symbols create a representation and thereby influence reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Danesi, Kidd clearly clarifies how one representation cannot equal one concept because of
                    important contextual factors. Kidd then furthers into semiotics on a deeper level and introduces why
                    this study is important to the topic at hand – because of the relation between form and content. To
                    understand how representation interacts with the other topic addresses in the piece, we must
                    understand that the signs and codes that inform our reality are products of representation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        <strong>
                            Basically, we construct and charge the meaning behind all objects.
                        </strong>
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kidd then moves to representation and myth, furthering on her point of context and charged meaning.
                    Here there is an exploration of the importance of the denotative, and the connotative – particularly
                    using the Apple Logo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She simply explains how denotatively, we could see the logo as representing only the apple as the
                    fruit it is widely known as, but connotatively it represents a brand, the Apple brand. The image of
                    the apple with a bite taken from it no longer just references an apple, but it suggests ideas of
                    lifestyle, financial class, personality perception and much more that is mostly influenced by an
                    individual’s bias. It is the way that the denotative and the connotative interact and form these
                    biased – but often shared - perceptions, that creates the myth – something we see as factual but is
                    created by man. In this case study, the myth is the view of those who are associated with, own or
                    involved with the Apple brand/products or don the Apple Logo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, this kind of visual communication of the connotation is an active form of representation,
                    and so Kidd continues into the relation between representation and visual communication, elaborating
                    on how the subjective nature of visuals can allow for a multitude of meanings to emerge, although
                    often – as mentioned before – there is a preferred or generally accepted (shared) meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With visuals, there is a necessity to consider the impact of the aura – as first brought forward by
                    Benjamin – of the visual work at hand. Simply, the aura of a work can be defined as the uniqueness
                    of the work, particularly in the time and space that it is engaged with in. The way the image
                    communicates with the audience is relevant to its current context – but also, it’s historical,
                    productive, and cultural contexts. The meaning of the visual can change dependent on how much
                    knowledge the audience has when interacting with it – and in turn how little.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To further on the previous example of the Apple Logo – the logo itself will be perceived and
                    interacted with differently in its context of origin, America versus in China – a competitor
                    climate. The socio-environmental state in which we encounter the representation will affect how we
                    perceive and connotate it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This leads to Kidd’s next major point – the relation of representation persuasion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the socio-environmental state in which we encounter the work affects our perception of it –
                    there is room to manipulate the audience and interactors of the visual (a factor that empowers
                    basically the entire advertising industry). In the line of advertising for example – and let us
                    again take the example of Apple – if we change how we represent the product, we can change how
                    people perceive it. When representing the latest iPhone in an advertisement, there is often a focus
                    on what is new, better, and improved. It is this focus on what of the object is represented, that
                    can change how people view it, and thereby create or target a preferred meaning – or myth. This
                    process over time or in great succession can cultivate the myth further, impacting the aura of the
                    object, and affecting the way we perceive the object, and how we then view the object
                    <em>
                        <strong>
                            in our reality.
                        </strong>
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This ability to persuade, makes representation a very powerful and very dangerous political tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to representation and identity politics, Kidd notes that there is an erratic amount of
                    change and constant re-representation of signs, symbols, visuals, and language. The power dynamics
                    created by representation play a vital role in how society operates and has operated for centuries.
                    With the increase of knowledge and awareness of the persuasive powers of representation, there is
                    and remain a strong fight for representations and the persuasive – and typically supremist way they
                    are both marketed and accepted into society, as well as across them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A main example of this problematic and forced representation brought up by Kidd is Orientalism.
                    Defined by Said, Orientalism refers to process in which the West creates stereotypical
                    representation of the East – typically the Middle East and East Asia. The reiteration of these
                    stereotypical portrayals of Middle Eastern people and East Asians, have created connotations of
                    negative note among a mass of consumers of the media – of which create a shared condescending view
                    of the East, through the eyes of a non-native commentator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the up rise of the technological age, the social networking platforms have opened opportunities
                    to denounce these false mad-made representations, and fight the powers of past colonial
                    representation – allowing for the marginalized, underrepresented and misrepresented to change what
                    has been consistently spread as acceptable when it – in fact – is derogatory, dehumanizing and
                    disgusting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Representation is vital in shaping the perceptions we have of reality, and it is our job to question
                    these representations that have been unchangingly fed to us and our predecessors. Kidd not only
                    clarifies the extremely significant correlation between politics and representation, she also makes
                    use and clearly simplifies the factors that influence representation, while also acknowledging and
                    bringing forward the dire consequences and effects of its persuasive power.
