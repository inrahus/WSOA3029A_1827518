                    Reflection on Data-Driven Visualisations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the semester, I found myself struggling to express the ties between the technical and
                    theoretical compents that would further my creative aspect. Although I personally feel that my
                    visualisations were a result of my efforts to tackle the technical and porduce something or the
                    other - in this reflective piece, I want
                    to elaborate more on what I wanted to achieve with my visuals and how my perspective on artistic
                    visuals has changed, as well as what I feel could have been better developed, and hwo I feel this
                    impacted the result of my final visualisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the task of displaying and conveying data visualisations about COVID, I was very interested and
                    extemly excited to to venture into the artistic visualisation side of coding. My main goal, was to
                    approahc the tasks from a visual perspective. I wanted my visualisations to look good To appeal. To
                    resonate with a sense of artistic beauty/aesthetic. With the development of the semester, and with
                    mostly recent encounters with theory, my perspective had definitely shifted. While engaging with the
                    work of Viégas and Wattenberg, my definition and understanding of what artistic visulisations are,
                    changed, and in that, I came to appreciate the fruits of my labour and the results of my efforts
                    more clearly. Using the definition for artistic visualisation as being, based and backed on
                    appropriate sources of data, while also engaging heavily with my intent in the creation (Viégas &
                    Wattenberg, 2007) of my graphs
                    (detailed individually beneath each graph), I do think I achieved my goal, but not in the sense that
                    I was expecting nor by the standards I previously measured my work and quality of work by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With my resulting works, I don't think that the mentality with which I approached the tasks allowed
                    me to really consider elements of representation and storytellling as holistically as I should have.
                    This is a clear aspect that could have been better considered and developed in my work. My focus on
                    completing the visualisations, as a rpimary goal, left no room for me to really pursue a more
                    accessible and target-audience oriented means of communication (Riche et al., 2018). I feel that if
                    I had established
                    this and clearly defined a story or target market, I could have more cohesively incorporated my
                    visualisation sinto my site, while also creating a more tailored visual experience (Riche et al.,
                    2018), rather than just
                    a final, aesthetic visual with no real narrative or feeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I feel I did to compensate for this lack of narrrative drive, was to include some aspects of it
                    - especially inmy pursuit to integrate the visuals, interactivity and progression of my visuals with
                    the site - particularly in my last two graph creations. I really aimed to use some sort of
                    unification from the site - directly with the use of color, and in the final visulisation that I
                    have now submitted, I attemted to create a sense of emergency with the colour gradient. Even though
                    this part of my owrk was not whole-y complete and somewhat lacking, I do think that my level of
                    skill and competency with JS - although improved - played a large role. Retropectively, I also have
                    to admit that, even if I had defined aspects such as a target audience or general narrative pursuit
                    - the focus on trying to get some sort of work out, to present a visual at the end of the day, could
                    have possibly still resulted in a similar end as where I now find my work. Or maybe not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my final visulaisation, I wanted to challenge myself and my skills, and aim to represent
                    something more than just data as it stands. I wanted to showcase my
                    reformed idea of what an artistic visual was, and I wanted to create an interactivity that would
                    display the contributing data that fueled the final graph. These were my new goals. And I do believe
                    I achieved them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my graph, I created a level movement so that the viewer of the visualisation could click on each
                    individual set of data, and see what components make up the data, while also showing the comparisons
                    between the data. In the context of the data we werw working with for this project, I think this
                    piece worked out extremely well within the bounds of it's accomplishment. The visual dataset was the
                    same as the previous pie chart, but with this bar graph repreentation, it was much easier to
                    showcase the rise in the
                    numbers and the severity of the pandemic and it's effects, without denouncing the importance of the
                    underlying data - which are the types of cases present. Although I wanted to show how severe the
                    pandemic and COVID was, I also wanted to show the what the numbers really meant - what they were
                    made of, what they actually represented - and with the leveling of the graphs, this was made
                    possible. This was, instead of just fearing the rise in numbers, the viewer can see what the number
                    actually is - and in recent months, they can see how the rise in reported total cases is actually
                    significantly made up of recovered cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a whole, this graph was to show two sides fo a coin. To show the viewer that COVID has a massive
                    effect, but also that in that, there is a reassurance of recovery and decrease in acive cases and
                    low death numbers. I feel this intent and the resulting display of data truely qualifies the work as
                    an artistic visual by means of the definition I now prioritise and subverts the very narrow minded
                    and aesthetic focused ideals I initally approached my visualisations with. Even though, with clearer
                    intent, there could have been significant inprovements in the communcation and creative aspects of
                    my visualisations, I do think that the effect of the theroetical shifted my critical perspective of
                    my work, to a very inclusive and more direct approach to my work, and that it is clear in the
                    progression of my data visuals displayed on the site.
