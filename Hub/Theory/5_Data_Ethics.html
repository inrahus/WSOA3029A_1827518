                    The Ethical Contribution of Art to Technology
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the scientific nature of technology, there is a presented risk and extreme concern relayed in
                    regards to the moral complexities of the subject, especially in the public eye. In this article,
                    Roeser showcases how the use of art can positively impact the perpectives of risky technology
                    through emotional-moral reflection produced by the arts engagement with the audience, while also
                    creating a better environment for decisions around
                    the risks presented by technological innovation, and therby allowing for a more morally balanced
                    approach
                    to the subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roser introduced the topic of techno-art - art used to reflect and engage with the presented risky
                    technologies available. Throughout history and even in the comtemporary spaces of today, we see this
                    techno-art that encompasses the ideals of art alongside the use of current and developing
                    technologies. Several modernist movements in the beginning of the 1900s actively embraced the
                    efficiency and celebrated the contributions of technology and we see its presence still in the
                    aspects of Contructivism and Futurism, and even in terms of literature in the popularity of
                    science-fiction. Howveer, this is not always the case and we see how critical persectives on
                    technology and risks presented by them have manifested in the existence of the dystopian genre
                    accross mediums, as well as in the era and through the current romanticism of the Romanticism era.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In current developments, particularly on the visual art front, we see how the inclusion and interest
                    in
                    technology, and it's advancement, has lead artists to experiment and create new forms of artworks
                    through the use of new materials and mediums. Artists like Stelarc, whose interests in bio-art,
                    performance and robotics lead to an interesting implant surgery, are finding new ways to emotionally
                    and provactively
                    engage
                    with
                    their audiences and explore the uses and capabilites of technology, outside the linear functions
                    they were designed for - allowing for a more conceptual branching of the developments - as well as
                    their ethical and legal bounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roeser
                    continues and mentions how art like Stelarc's reaches the audience - the public - in a very direct
                    manner to their emotional and imaginative extents. Roeser makes it explicit that the topic of
                    techno-art's affect on the emotional, is lacking
                    of
                    academic backing, and this is a major aspect that needs to be addressed moving forward. The
                    tangible effect of techno-art on the audience and their emotional responses to it, creates a space
                    in which we can critically reflect on
                    the technology presented, while also discussing and addressing the moral implications of such
                    advancement. As mentioned in the article, if we take Stelarc and his ear-on-arm implant - we could
                    see how the potential interest and fascination of technology and the extent of it's capabilites
                    would increase -
                    but we will also be exposed to and see the critical aspect of the abnormal phsycial production of a
                    ear on an arm
                    or the perspective that the art is a "waste" of the technology. With the furthering of
                    investigations
                    in to these responses to techno-art, the genre can serve as a prosperous grounds for the ethical
                    basis of technology, it's uses and the ethical facets that need to be addressed surrounding it and
                    from there, the public's responses to the technology in question.
                <p>
                    A direct method of this is through the intergration of paticipatory technology assessment - which
                    already exists to ensure democratic decisiveness on risky technology - and the genre of technoart.
                    By allowing for artists to gauge and reflect on the permeation of the technology with the audience
                    and their lives,
                    we can address and target concerns about the risks of the technology, while also challenging and
                    monitoring the legal and moral standpoint of the technology in a space that caters for the freedom
                    of
                    expression. However this raises concerns and challenges in the art community - as the merits on the
                    artistic front are ambiguous, and the ethical implications - even in a space of expression - may
                    seem chaotic and endangering. Although there is a lack of guidelines in this particular avenue of
                    art, techno-art shoould operate on a baiss that is appropriately contained, constrained and
                    cautioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Roeser explains, this intergration and display in the real world context, could potentially allow
                    us to
                    overcome the Collingridge dilemma, and prevent the spread of unknown detriment presented
                    by past technologies and the inability of society to timely regulate the effect of the technology.
                    The introdution of techno-art in both the scientific and artistic fields brings forward a great
                    chance to prevent the undesirable - the irreversible and unfortuante event that could take place.
                    The ability of artists in the field to move past the limits of the developers and the scientific
                    communities, allows us to more realistically and meaningfully explore the technology's risks and
                    its permeation with
                    society, as well as how the emotional response to such risky technology can allow for a reflection
                    that morally guides the creation and development of potential and newer technologies.
