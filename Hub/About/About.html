                <h2>
                    vis.co - Website Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main goal I had with this site was to approach form a visual perspective. I really wanted to
                    incorporate colour and use it to section different parts of the website while maintaining a very
                    simplistic style and easy navigation. I also wanted to move forward from my last sememster website
                    and try to also emphasis the responsiveness of the site. I spent a goo dmajority of time prior to
                    the start of the sememter watching a lot of tutorials on how to utilise CSS for this, while also
                    sticking mainly to the idea of simplicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, there were many aspects of the site that did not come to frutation, mostly because of
                    skill and time, but until exam submission, I believe that all can still be achieved, even if it is
                    not yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first part of the site I worked on was the navigation. In my previous site, I was unable to use
                    JS at all, and tried to see if I could use it for animations in my nav bar, that could potentially
                    be used throughout the site. Although I did manage to get it to work on my homepage - in which it
                    scrolls along the bar as you move from section to section, I struggled
                    with the interference of the JS on other pages of the site, and as a result, I decided to use CSS to
                    mimic the effect of the hover present on the homepage nav, using the nav as a wholesite menu of
                    sorts, in which it would take to to the base of the section, which is on the homepage, and then
                    allow you to
                    navigate from there using links/buttons/cards. I really wanted a cohesivity between the nav and the
                    sections, and the use of this colour coding on a black background, with a black to colour gradient
                    for each sectioon helped me achieve that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next part was the sections. As I developed the site, I realised I could narrow down my sections
                    to a minimal with focus on the visualisations (technical), theory and then - after recieving feeback
                    about my
                    character, I realsing I could be using the about for my character
                    basis and website development discussions - which is what you are now seeing/reading...
                </p>
                <p>
                    With regards to the character - I definitely did not have a clear idea of one prior to the last
                    feedback, but now I believe I have come to create a very anonymous character. Almost informat like.
                    Currently I am still developing this character, as the inpiration came quite late towards the end of
                    this assignment. I am aspiring to create a percievable character that is knowledgeable and adequate
                    in data display and colour use. I want the site to be a reflection of the character's interests - so
                    not to directly display them, but rather use the site as a outlet of knoweldge and
                    experimentation.'I do feel it is very vague, but I think I could potentially get this across with
                    more additions to my About, where I could discuss more about the making of the visuals and extra
                    detailing behind the site. Potentially, I see cards being made for this section as well by exam
                    submission (hopefully).
                </p>

                    <img class="DVIMG" src="./Images/BlogCard_1.jpg"
                        alt="Intial Blog Card - Landscape with image on left and text to the right.">
                </a>
                <p>
                    Above was the one item I really had visualised - that I wanted to potentially create and use, and
                    then have it
                    responsonsively change to portrait format if necessary. However given time and circumstance
                    I ended up opting for the portrait one throughout. I have tried multiple time to change the card
                    layout to this and have it change responsively, but unfortunately it constantly presents problems in
                    responsivity that I don't know how to fix yet. I would like to implement this card design to create
                    some variation in the site. I would like to use these landscape cards for the visualisations, and
                    the portrait ones for posts. I believe it wil help with the monotony of the site and further the
                    creative aspect. Currently I have left it out but will continue to try am implement it by the exam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I honestly did not make explicit wireframes for my site. I knew what kind of focus I wanted on the
                    different elements and parts of the site, and then experiemented with different layouts and sizings
                    till I felt it
                    emcompassed the aspects I wanted. A lot of the site was a result of trial and error - seeing what
                    worked and what didn't. In the case of the blog post layout, I really wanted the simplest layout
                    that would give focus to the content. In my previous site I also opted for this but it relayed quite
                    badly as a wall of text that was very hard to read. i did some research into fonts which I then
                    ended up applying to the entire site, and using a black block on colour background style to add
                    layering an give a more refined feel to the site. I wanted to implement this effect in my About
                    section on the homapage but it hasn't been working out very well and relays quite dully - so for the
                    meantime I have decided to leave it quite bare in plain text. I still want to address the lack of
                    cohesiveness between the button and the text - both in colour and style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With regards to the actual content and my theory work. I have been made aware that I have been quite
                    harsh on myself, and moving forward I would like to make the changes I proposed by my final
                    submission. I did really enjoy these topics and would definitely like to further on them - however,
                    I do want to for this Assignment 2, focus on improving my technical to a passing mark first, and so
                    I
                    emphasised my efforts there - although fairly I do not think this partucular aspect is in my
                    strengths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next was my responsivity. I worked between my own mobile device (iPhone) and the site - using the
                    inspect on screen when coding mostly to address other devices. I often found issues when addressing
                    android and given feedback form the previous assignment, I think this was still ill addressed. For
                    this submission I focused more on fixing my technical and did not address this
                    part at all - moving forward, I definitely want to. Especially given that I myself wanted this part
                    of the site to be a major focus. I am not sure how yet but I want to apply the responsivity to my
                    graphs as well but I am struggling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of the technical...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was initially unaware that we were using D3 (due to personal circumstances I was behind in
                    technical) and used Chart.js - so I spent most of my time trying
                    to learn D3 and implement it but I struggled. A lot. I removed my inital visualisation and
                    decided to make two new ones using D3. I don't have too much to say right now, but in terms of my
                    goals, I still want
                    to try and keep the colur theme of black and yellow/off-yellow-green for my data - or somehow tie in
                    the
                    theme of the section ot the visuals by my exam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall there is not a lot of improvement in anything other than the technical (and it is
                    barely there).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Update:
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have decided to not split the post, and just update it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the feedback received from the last submission, I have decided to move on and focus on my
                    stronger
                    point - theory. I have struggled a lot with D3 and have detailed that in each graph post. I also
                    decided that moving forward with the visualisations a a whole, I will attempt to but at least
                    something out,
                    despite the difficulties. I - for the most part - am struggling to filfil the interactive and
                    cohesive nature of the graphs that make up the creative aspect, but I feel that, at this point,
                    getting something at all out from that end is quite an achievemnt for myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next point is the responsivity of the site. Unfortunately, with the graphs, I am struggling to
                    ruther my site responsivity, and have noticed some bugs appearing through the updates I make to the
                    site and I think it may be the JS for my swoosh that I havent removed from most of the pages, with
                    the exam submission, I intend to remove this and aviod that, but in the case of the graph
                    responsivity, I am still unsure of how to approach this issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final Update:
                </p>
                <p>
                    This semester has been quite a ride. I was able to clearly improve my skills in D3 within the last
                    month, as well as my comprehensivity of JS. My strengths clearly lied in my use of CSS and combined
                    HTML, but again, I am very proud of my progress with the coding aspects of the course, especially
                    the more technical nature of JS.
                    Throughout the design and maintainance of this site, I realised that I really have a very big vision
                    for tasks and projects I wish to accomplish, and that sometimes my skills do not match this vision,
                    but with the current state of progress, I could easily see myself furthering in a profession of this
                    nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the site, I am very happy with the fina outcome, espeically consdiering the means of education
                    and the external curcumstances I fond myself in. BEing able to grasp skills that I was very inept at
                    last semesetr was very fulfilling, and seeing my work appreciated, made me feel even more so.
                    ALthoug i wasn't able to fully realise the extent of my site as I had intented, I am satisfied with
                    the esults and am porud to present the site vis.co as it stands now.
                </p>
