            <p>
                With this visualisation, I not only wanted to display new COVID data, but also try and show the severity
                of the pandemic while also attempting a new type of graph. I chose a bar graph to show the progression
                of the cases and limited the data - to
                again, make input easier. I am still struggling with correctly implementing the API and deriving direct
                data, and so, for my visualsations, have been manually applying the datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this graph, I struggled in implementing a color scale - although looking back on my previous one, I
                had issues and decided to - for the sake of moving forward contain this to a singular colour. At first,
                it was a royall blue, but, in an attempt to pursue the aesthetic and intergrate it more with the site, I
                decided to immitale the colour used in the Data gradient BG and tab colour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly, I am stuggling a lot with D3, especially in trying to implement some sort of interactivity,
                and have been using various different resources to try and accomplish the bare minimum for the tasks
                assigned for this
                section. Moving forward, I would like to keep this sort of colour but add some sort of responsivity or
                reactvity or interactivity for the next two graphs.
