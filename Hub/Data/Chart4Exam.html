                With this graph, I think I was clearly able to show the extent of my D3 abilities, as well as my overal
                competency with JS. Although I did struggle, and this can cleary be seen in the size of the graph which
                I couldn't really figure out how to change wthout my whole graph disappearng. I am howevevr very happy
                with the result - particuarly in terms of colour, and in the display of interactivity with which I
                struggled for so long with over the semester.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this visualisation, I wanted to further show the data in it's individual components. However, an
                issue I only noticed post completion, is that on return to the main graph, the bars reverse in position.
                I was unable to address this in time, but I am stil heavily satisfied with the final outcome of my
                project, especially considering the numerous stuggles I encountered in this section of work thorough the
                semester. I also ended up removing th elabels I had for the axes, as with the switch in levels, the
                labels did not correspond and tended to overlap in some cases. Although I feel this would have furthered
                the graph more, I think that the lack does not heavily take away from the presented information.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the new undrstanding of tooltips - which I incorporated into my last graph, but did not clearly
                communicate to the user - I was able to further on this and create a meaningful hover effect that
                allowed me to showcase the information from the tooltip to the viewer in a more cohesive and interactive
                style. And I also incorporated the highlighting feature - also used before - to further the
                interactivity. I also used a cursor change to a pointer so that there was clear indication that the bars
                could be clicked. In retrospect, I feel that I could have possibly done more to show the clicking aspect
                of the bar alongside the highlighting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another point to note, is that this data set is the same as previous, but with more depth into the
                individual compnentes that make up the massive number of confirmed cases. I also shifted the range of
                data fom MArch to November, to April to November. This was because the bar for March was so smal, no
                interactive compoments could work with it. If I could have figured out the size of my graph in time, I
                belive I would have left it in, and showcases the full amount of COVID data in South Africa since the
                beginning of quarantine.
            </p>
            <p>
                I aso changed the colour scale - although it incorporates colours from the website, I tried to show the
                increase with a sense of emergency, particularly in the moevement from green to yellow to red. I feel
                that this does come across, but that if the graph was larger, the severity would be better
                communicated.
            </p>
            <p>
                (Also, I couuldn't really figure out the positioning of the "Return"button, but it still works... Sorry
                about that.)
