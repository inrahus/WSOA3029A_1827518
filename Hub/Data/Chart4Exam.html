            <p>
                For this chart, I decided to experiment with some interactive features - despite not being able to
                clearly visualise them for the viewer. As you can see, there are some readabilty issues with the chart -
                particularly with regard to the numbers on the chart. However, when hovering over each section or even
                the corresponding colour in the legend, we can see the number for each month/colour clearly. There is
                also a disparity in the in-pie text versus the legend text - I am still sorting out how to change this
                and hopefully will achieve it in time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am actually very happy with this chart - it was initally a missing part of my previous submission and
                so, I used it to experiement with some components that I would like to use in my final submission
                visualisation. I was also able to finally see how to use my own colours for a color scale and so, I used
                all colours present in the website, as well as some additional colours that I felt would brightly suit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I do not think the pie chart best represents the data - which was again, manually entered, but
                I do think that I have a clear idea and go-ahead for my final visualisation, as well as for the
                interactivity that I want to use for it. Looking over all my charts, I
                think there is a clear progression and significant progress with my capabilities in D3. However, at this
                current point, I think there is still a significant lack in the progress of combining the visual
                cohesively to my site. This is my primary goal for my final visual, as well as something I wish to
                tackle and express in my final theoretical post.

                (Also, I am not quite sure what I did, but it seems my return button has shited from it's center for
                some
                reason, and I cannot move it back to center for this post - but again, hopefully it will be fine in my
                final.)
